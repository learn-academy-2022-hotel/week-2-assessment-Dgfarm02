# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: a parameter is a placeholder or a variable, an argument is the data you put into the parameter that is being manipulated.

Researched answer: an argument is the value that is declared within a function when the function is called and a parameter is defined when the function is declared.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: ohhh I think there are three of them and the order of them is important but i'm forgetting what they are. I think it's array, index and one more...

Researched answer: aahh currentValue is the one I forgot. 

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: map takes an array and iterates through it and creates a new array with the same number of indexes with modified values. filter is used to take an array and create a new array but it only shows the elements you have specified.

Researched answer: map returns a new array of elements where you have applied some function on the element so that it changes the original element (typically). filter returns a new array of the elements of the original array (with no change to the original values). filter will only return elements where the function you specify returns a value of true for each element passed to the function.

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: iteration is something that repeats until a certain condition is met, each repetition is one iteration. 

Researched answer: Iteration occurs when we want to execute code once for each item in a collection, usually elements in an array or properties of an object.

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer: class is a template or blueprint that spits our objects, objects can be a lot of things but it is created from a class. 

Researched answer: a class can only be established once, and an object can be established multiple times

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: I have no idea

Researched answer: the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. User stories: an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user or customer. 

2. Spread operator: The spread operator is commonly used to make shallow copies of JS objects. Using this operator makes the code concise and enhances its readability.

3. React state:  built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component.

4. React props: stands for properties, which refers to the properties of an object.

5. DOM events: nothing but a nativeEvent mapped to the browser in which the app is running.
